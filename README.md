# Isaac-Jones-in-a-Temple-Source

Isaac Jones in a Temple is a game developed by Alireza Nickooie, Raymond Zhao,and Jacky Chen as a senior year project. The goal of the project was to demonstrate many elements of Object Oriented Programing in a creative manner and it was coded during a 1 month period from may to june 2015.

The game is meant to be a parody/clone of the famous game "The Binding of Isaac". In this game you play as the protagonist Isaac Jones and in order to complete the game you have to traverse through 3 floors of a dungeon and retrieve the treasure within. The challanges you encunter include mines, bats, turrets, and overly complicated puzzles, just to name a few. 

The project was completely coded from scratch using Java and OpenGL.

This repository only includes the source code.

Have Fun!
